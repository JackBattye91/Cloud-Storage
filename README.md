# Cloud Storage
Cloud Storage uses a Blazor web app, asp.net API and some Azure services to setup a online file storage website. Users can setup an account with an email address and password, and get an activation link emailed to them via SendGrid. Once an account has been setup users can start using the service, there is a secure folder which can only be accesssed once the user is authenticated via MFA.
